architectures enable us to reason about complex systems

SRC84
Contribution: synthesized ideas that had been applied into a cogent definition.
Summary:

- Design principle for fun placement in a distributed system
- Cost/Benefit of pushing functions down to network
- Functions should only be pushed down to improve performance

Paper proceeds with example of simple/reliable data transfer
     - One must be careful with using performance as the justification of pushing functions down because
performance could be the same if they implemented at higher levels.


Impact:
* Routers a fairly simple.
* TCP/IP are actually a part of the OS.
