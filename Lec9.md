TCP Ex Mchina
Internet now includes diverse technology e.g. data centers, wireless, dedicated long haul.

Prior congestion cotrol alogrithm were designed witha relatively static notion of networks.


Tranform more like
```
===============	               ______
									    __|     |__	
===============       or      __      ___
										   |_____|
```



Prior versions of TCP were "hand crafted" This paper describes TCP Remy, which is based on an optimazaton model and machine generatd Based on input from environment Models are focused on sending behavior. -->  Approach is described and then examined through extensive simulation study.

Good summary of prior work. The focus is when we send packet.

What can we change in order to produce a "new" TCP?
--> Signal of congestion
--> How to respond the signal of congestion
--> Timing and Timeout
--> Startup behavior

Approach for Remy -> create a model for congestion control.
